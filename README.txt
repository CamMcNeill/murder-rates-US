Following rafalab's instructions to explore creating my first Rproj

We analyze US gun murder data collected by the FBI

downloaded-data.R -downloads csv to /data

wrangle-data.R - creates a derived dataset and saves a .rda to /rdas

analysis.R - generates a plot and saves it to /figs

make-greeting.R - a file for me to test how source() works 
                    (turns out source runs in the working directory, not the directory of the script)
